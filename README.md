# Kumabot

Tired of JS-based bots breaking after every minor update (with its `node_modules` dependency hell), or Java-based bots consuming too much memory for a simple utility? Kumabot is built for people who want a "set it and forget it" experience.

It is a high-performance, low-footprint Discord music bot written in Go, utilizing native FFmpeg bindings via go-astiav and a custom Opus jitter buffer to ensure seamless audio delivery. Kumabot aims to be the most stable, efficient, and reliable Discord music bot available.

## Technical Highlights

- Native Audio Pipeline: Direct integration with libavcodec and libavformat for resampling and encoding.
- Jitter Management: Custom opusBuffer ensures smooth playback across varying network conditions.
- Query Resolution: Supports YouTube, Spotify metadata resolution, and HLS streams.
- Persistence: Per-guild configurations and user favorites stored via SQLite.

## YouTube Bot Detection Bypass

YouTube enforces Proof of Origin (PO) tokens to attest that requests come from a genuine client. Check out [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide) guide for a more accurate direction.

### 1. Obtaining a PO Token
Manual Extraction:
1. Open a browser and navigate to YouTube Music.
2. Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to the Network tab.
3. Filter by v1/player.
4. Play any video and inspect the latest player request.
5. Under serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken in the Response JSON, copy the token.
6. Set this as your YOUTUBE_PO_TOKEN environment variable.

### 2. Exporting Cookies
1. Open a Private/Incognito browser window.
2. Log in to YouTube.
3. Export the cookies in Netscape format using an extension.
4. Close the incognito window immediately after exporting.
5. Save the file to $DATA_DIR/cookies.txt.
